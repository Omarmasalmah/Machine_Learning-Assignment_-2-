# Machine_Learning-Assignment_-2-

🗯️In this project, we delve into various models and methods, such as polynomial regression, ridge regression, and logistic regression. Our goal is to not only implement these models but also optimize their performance through model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Through clear visualizations and straightforward analyses, we aim to demystify machine learning concepts and showcase the practical aspects of building and refining models.
